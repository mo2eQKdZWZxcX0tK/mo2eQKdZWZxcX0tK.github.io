This architecture enables deeper reasoning in scientific, mathematical, and programming tasks, achieving a 63.8% score on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark.  
• **Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental**: Launched in March 2025, this model supports **1M-token context windows** (expandable to 2M) and integrates multimodal analysis for complex decision-making. It outperforms Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet in code generation and scientific reasoning.  

#### **1.2 Scaling Law Evolution and Model Miniaturization**  
• **50-Trillion-Parameter Models**: IBM’s Martin Keane predicted that parameter counts would surge to 50 trillion by 2025, enabling AI to tackle multidimensional problems in healthcare and climate modeling.  
• **Edge AI Revolution**: Compact models like Apple’s 3B-parameter **On-Device Model** and Tsinghua University’s **Chitu Inference Engine** have democratized AI. These models run on smartphones and IoT devices, reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure while maintaining performance comparable to Mistral-7B.  

#### **1.3 Multimodal World Models**  
• **Emu3 by Beijing Academy of AI (BAAI)**: This **autoregressive native multimodal model** unifies video, image, and text processing, achieving state-of-the-art results in industrial and healthcare applications. Its training framework aligns modalities from inception, minimizing information loss in traditional "post-fusion" approaches.  
• **NVIDIA’s Cosmos**: Released in January 2025, Cosmos is the first generative world model capable of simulating 3D environments for autonomous systems like robotics and autonomous vehicles.  

#### **1.4 Embodied Intelligence and Robotics**  
• **RT-X Series by Google DeepMind**: The RT-2 model introduced **vision-language-action (VLA) integration**, enabling robots to interpret environmental cues and execute tasks like warehouse restocking with 99.9% millimeter-level precision.  
• **Galbot by Galaxy General**: Deployed in unmanned pharmacies, this system uses a hybrid of 3D vision models and foundational LLMs for real-time inventory management.
